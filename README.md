# 2019-summer
This is a class project for summer 2019 for security tool development class.
I build a small python script that utilizes socke module to get data from the socket.
In the project I have made the connection to the socket, retrieved ip and fully qualified domain name from the socket. And finally printed the data received int he socket.
This was build in ubuntu (linux platform)
