# 2019-summer
This is a class project for summer 2019 for security tool development class.
I build a small python script that utilizes socke module to get data from the socket.
In the project I have made the connection to the socket, retrieved ip and fully qualified domain name from the socket. And finally printed the data received int he socket.
This was build in ubuntu (linux platform)
Instructions:
Download the project-one.py file and save it.
Install all necessary requirment for python (if not already done)
Navigate to the Dir where file is saved
Run the program by running following command
sudo python3 project-one.py
